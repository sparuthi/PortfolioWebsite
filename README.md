# PortfolioWebsite

Portfolio Website: Shanaia Paruthi

Description: 

The website gives a subtle sense of me as a person. It gives a simplistic and artistic outlook. It is easy to navigate around with not much complications. 
I started by making an initial index page for the website which welcomes the user. The user has to furthermore click on the picture which rotates and redirects to the actual main page of the website. This part of the website is ultimately divided into four parts: the homepage, the section about me, my works that are the class assignments and the contact information. Each page tells a little bit about me. The whole theme of the overall website is orange and black/ash-grey that's because I felt that the orange, a bright colour,  and black/ash-grey, the classics were contrasting each other, more or less like the work I have done throughout the semester. 

Process: 

I started by dividing the work into two HTML pages. The first one was for the main welcome page for the website and the other has my actual profile. The welcome website is consistent of a text that says “Hello”, and “Welcome” with a typing effect which I  made using a JS library online. It also consists of a circle which had my picture in it. When you click this circle, it rotates and redirects the user to the profile html page for user interactivity. 
The second HTML page is the profile HTML page which consist of the four sections as told above. The script usually uses CSS to guide all the elements on the page around along with HTML and very little JavaScript. I tried adding a few effects such as bubbles for the homepage using Javascript but the website overall became a little too distracting and therefore I had to let them go. The page I was in navigation bar which will lead to navigate around entire web page. I have used the smooth-scroll-behaviour to smooth out the scrolling while navigating so that the user can see the flow of the webpage as they navigate throughout the webpage. This gives the user a proper knowledge to what is exactly on the webpage instead of just directing themselves to what they want. I'm also use the AOS JS library to fade up the elements as you scroll down . I also used the same for the underline below all titles. 
Both the HTML pages has separate CSS and JavaScript files for each one of them because I made them both separately at first and then connected them together through a JavaScript code. 

Challenges: 

The main challenge was the CSS positioning and the redirecting of all the HTML files from the index to the profile HTML. I also spent a lot of time on finding the right effects for each website first on learning how to derive those effects and then seeing if they fit on the page. Mostly all effects were becoming a little distracting from the main website and so I let my website be as simple as possible so the user’s main focus can be my portfolio instead of the effects on my website. I also tried getting I need a Preview for each website but it was more difficult than I thought, and I did not have enough time to learn the same. 

Overall I learnt a lot through this website. It gives an overview to my course, and I hope this helps you understand my journey this past semester. Thank you.
